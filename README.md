Description:

You are a newly graduated student from the University of Newcastle (UON) majoring in software engineering. During your study, you have developed an augmented reality software for home design that you think it is worth patented for the innovative features it has.

Some features that you claimed to be available in your software are:

<ul>
<li>â€“ &nbsp;Users can use the AR software to not only capture images with their phones, but also insert
3D models into virtual spaces.
</li>
<li>â€“ &nbsp;3D models can be viewed from all angles.</li>
<li>â€“ &nbsp;3D model furniture are real products downloaded from user`s chosen store`s database (eg.
IKEA, Domayne, Nick Scali etc)..
</li>
<li>â€“ &nbsp;User are able to see how an item would look in any location of their home or setting it in real
size without having to buy it.
</li>
<li>â€“ &nbsp;Users may order online directly through the app interface if they see it fit their home. *Please add more features that you think are unique.
In order to apply for the innovation patent of your software, you have to send your application to IP Australia. Instead of using the service of a patent attorney, you have decided to apply for the patent at your own by visiting the IP Australia website. The following information have been summarized from the IP Australia website with regards to applying the innovation patent.

The following documents are required in order to lodge your innovation patent application:
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>A Patent Request: Innovation Patent Form</li>
<li>A complete specification of your software</li>
</ol>
NOTE: Both of these documents have been combined into one document on Canvas named INFT3800 â€“ PATENT REQUEST FORM &amp; TEMPLATE.

<ol>
<li>Patent Request Form â€“ Innovation Patent
The patent request form for an innovation patent is made up of three parts and must include all applicants and the nature of the invention. All completed parts must be signed by the same person and filed at the same time. In this case, you are the sole creator of your software.
</li>
<li>Complete Specification</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
A complete specification is made up of Title, Description, Claims, an Abstract and Drawings (optional). The specification should be drafted carefully. This is the document on which a patent, if granted, is based.

Title

The title should appear on the first page (from the UON template is page 3).

Description

It is important to include a full description of your invention when you file a complete application.

Claims

Claims are an important concept and function. Patent â€˜claimsâ€™ work based on exclusive rights to an invention. If you try to claim too much, it may be difficult to obtain or at least defend those rights. However, if you claim too little you may miss out on valuable opportunities. Poorly worded claims can be confusing and completely miss the true â€˜inventive stepâ€™ in your technology.

Claims are important because they determine the scope of the monopoly given by a patent. The claims must:

<ul>
<li>be clear and concise</li>
<li>distinguish your invention from what is already known</li>
<li>set out all the essential technical features of your invention</li>
<li>be consistent with the description.
Statements about advantages of your invention are not suitable as claims. An innovation patent can have up to five claims.

Abstract

Patent applications can be lengthy, technical documents. You must include an abstract at the back of your specification to act as an executive summary. This will help the reader quickly identify the key features of your invention. Note: drawings are optional but recommended if they help explain your invention.

Format

Your Patent specifications should follow the formality requirements determined by the Commissioner of Patents of Australia that is available in the following link. : https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/patents/applying-patent/what-to-include-in-application/best- practice-guide-presenting-specification
